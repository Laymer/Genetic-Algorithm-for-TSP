# Genetic-Algorithm-for-TSP
Solving TSP in non exponential time complexity using genetic algorithm

This project contains 2 codes. One is serial code which can be run on a C compiler.


Second is to be run on GPU using CUDA for further reducing the time required by using parallel programming.

I have uploaded both files serial.c(for runing on c compiler) and parallel.cu(for running on cuda compiler
